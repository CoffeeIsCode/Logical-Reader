    <h3>Take adblock to the extreme.</h3>
    <p>
        We take ads and the mmethods that block them very seriously. You will never see an add on any pruduct that make. With that being said we are limited to either selling a product or donations to make moeny. Since we aren't ones to pressure anyone to buy a product we ask that you make a donation.

    <h3>Less is more</h3>
    <p>
		Read more in less time no matter what 
        When we started working on the Logical Reader you know today it was an accident. That's right we were working on something different called <a href="">Messify</a> and as soon as we figured out that it could be used to help people we put all our resources into making Logical Reader.
    </p>
	<h3>It just works, anywhere</h3>
	<p>
		That's right. It doesn't matter if you are reading a blog entery or a wikipedia article, Logical Reader runs in the background changing text quicker than the browser can display it. 
	</p>
	<samp>Please note that some sites that block adblockers may not work. This is because they asyncnously send content to the browser to make sure that thier website isn't tampered with. It's rare and there is a work around that we are exploring, but it's most likely to be in our paid version.</samp>
    <h3>It's good enough for Google</h3>
    <p>
        Right now both Google and microsoft have reviewed our products and some of the staff have reached out to us in guiding us to build a healthy inititive for all. Read more about that <a href="">here.</a>

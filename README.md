 ### What is Logical? ###
   ----------------  
 >- Logical was a concept that I thought of and it quickly spiraled
   out of control. Logical makes it so you can read up to 30x faster
   by condening content into a way that you have to think about what
   you are looking at instead of just reading lines of 
 >- This application was developed on accident when making Messify
   an extension made to turn any site or blog into a comedic and fun
   experience. Logical is so advanced that Messify v1.0.4 was built 
   into Logical v1.0.7 (this version) effortlessly. Messify grabs
   a couple words and randomly changes words to give you dynamic
   and always different feel. But it just wasn't enough...
 >- All my time quickly went towards crafting, debuging and refining
   our software over and over again. 

   What's New In This Version 
   --------------------------
 - Added nodeCount() function to make sure the page isn't broken after running.
 - Minor changes to getTime() to better understand loadtimes.
 - Added new words from firefox and MS.
 
   Apologic
   --------
 - Sorry, we messed up, but we're happy that we did. 
   Logical was an accident that became something that changed 
   the way some of us read. With the skim settings activated Logical can allow us to read up to 30x faster while getting the same rough story. 
   

   How it works:
   -------------
   - When you browse any website, before the page loads, logical Reader scans the page and depending on the settings selected can make all kinds of interesting
   changes.
 - Are minds are constantly doing all kinds of prossingare all coders at heart  Thinking logically and recognizing 
   patterns in the back of our minds as we do everything everyday.
   With logical it's less about reading and more about the big picture.

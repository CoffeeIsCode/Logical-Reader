# Logical.JS ReadMe File #

## What does Logical do? ##

> Logical grabs content from your browser as it's being loaded
and makes changes before it even hits the page. This way we are
able to process the text and refine it before it even hits the
page saving you a lot of time reading filler words or words that
shouldn't be included.

## How to use Logical ##

> Right now Logical is in development and isn't ready to be tested.
>
### What is Logical? ###

 > Logical was a concept that I thought of and it quickly spiraled
   out of control. Logical makes it so you can read up to 30x faster
   by condensing content into a way that you have to think about what
   you are looking at instead of just reading lines of
   This application was developed on accident when making Messify
   an extension made to turn any site or blog into a comedic and fun
   experience. Logical is so advanced that Messify v1.0.4 was built
   into Logical v1.1.5 (this version) effortlessly. Messify grabs
   a couple words and randomly changes words to give you dynamic
   and always different feel. But it just wasn't enough...
   All my time quickly went towards crafting, debugging and refining
   our software over and over again.

### How does it work ###

 Are minds are constantly doing all kinds of background functions and we always processing and recognizing patterns. Our aim is to make that process easier.
 When you browse any website, before the page loads, logical scans the page and depending on the settings selected can make all kinds of interesting changes to the page.
 With logical it's less about reading and more about the big picture.

- Added nodeCount() function to make sure the page isn't broken after running.

## Apiologies ##

- Sorry, we messed up, but we're happy that we did.
   Logical was an accident that became something that changed
   the way some of us read. With the highest version of Logical
   (Logical Pro) we are able to read up to 30x faster while
   getting the same rough story.

## How it works ##

   -------------

- We are all coders at heart. Thinking logically and recognizing
   patterns in the back of our minds as we do everything everyday.
   With logical it's less about reading and more about the big picture.
